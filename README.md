# Scheduling-algorithms

A Process Scheduler schedules different processes to be assigned to the CPU based on particular scheduling algorithms. In this codebase, I used Java to implement the following process scheduling algorithms. 

- Round Robin(RR) Scheduling
- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) Scheduling
- Priority Scheduling
- Shortest Job First (SJF) Scheduling
